# Tech Blog Site

## Description

Have you ever wanted to have a reddit style forum blog for developers to share tips, tricks, or  simply just share ideas? This blog provides that perfect space for developers to come together, communicate, and share ideas back and forth. 

This is a CMS-style blog site that allows users to log in to their account and to create, edit and delete posts, as well as comment on other's posts. 

Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Technology Used

This app uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
